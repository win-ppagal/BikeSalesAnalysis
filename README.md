# BikeSalesAnalysis
Bike Sales Data Analysis using Excel.

Project Description
---------------------------------
In this demo Bike Sales dataset, I analyzed key sales trends and buying bike considerations of customers. Moreover, I used Excel to clean, transform, and visualize the data leading to actionable insights for business decision-making.

Cleaning and Transforming Data
--------------------
A. Removed duplicates and used FIND and REPLACE functions to replace abbreviations with appropriate values.

B. Used NESTED IF function to create 3 conditional age brackets namely:
1. "Adolescent" 
2. "Middle Age"
3. "Old"


Data Analysis
--------------------

Created pivot tables to summarize the data and identify factors such as Average Income, Commute Distance and Age which truly affect the customer bike purchase decision. See pivot tables snippets below:

Dashboard Development
--------------------

Created interactive dashboard using Excel and added Filters and Slicers so users can seamlessly customize their view at a glance. See dashboard snippet below:

Key Insights
--------------------

- The Middle Age Group (31-54) shows the highest number of bike purchases. The Sales Team should focus on this group with promotions as they're more likely to respond positively and buy bikes.

- Both male and female with higher average income in their respective category were more likely to purchase bikes.

- Short distance commuters tend to purchase bikes compared to long distance commuters.
